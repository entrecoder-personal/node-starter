# EntreCoder Node Starter

This is a node starter website for developers to build their projects upon.

Whether you are learing to code, building a prototype or write a scalable app for your startup, you need a place to start. Even experienced software engineers who explore Node.js can't figure out where to start. Node.js is by far the fastest growing programming language, adding over 400 modules (plugins) a day totalling over 300,000. The reason for this is simple, its JavaScript, its the language of the browser and now has a backend framework to match. 

I started this project because I was teaching Node.js, but my students had a hard time learning conventions such as routing, controllers, views, validation, AJAX and front-end frameworks. It was easier for them to simply study an example and use it as a base to build real projects upon. Node.js is evolving so fast, that if you spend too much time trying to understand each framework and NPM module, you will never get your prototype off the ground.
